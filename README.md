I began studying math and the factorization problem back in the summer of 2023. 
Not having achieved higher education, I had the learn everything from the ground up.
The paper and proof of concept are the result of one year of work. The paper is very flawed due to my at the time limited understanding. (i.e things such as the "rebasing" step are not needed, since they are already congruent mod p)

However, representing factorization as Quadratic coefficients, despite my many other flaws, did turn out to be a very good appraoch.
In my other repository (https://github.com/BigPolarBear1/Factorization_new) I have modified quadratic sieve to use quadratic coefficients instead.

My next step will be to modify GNFS to use quadratic coefficients, I expect this to outperform vanilla number field sieve.
